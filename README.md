## ⚡ Fun Fact:
The first computer bug was literally a bug! 🪲 In 1947, Grace Hopper and her team found a moth trapped in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer. They taped it into their logbook and labeled it as the "first actual case of a bug being found." That's where the term "debugging" comes from!

Crazy how a tiny moth shaped the way we talk about fixing code today! 😆
